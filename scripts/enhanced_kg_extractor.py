        return """-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1.  Go through each individual line in the input and Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
    entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized as it appears or a common proper noun form.
    entity_id: A unique, capitalized identifier for the entity, comprehensive enough to distinguish it in different contexts. This ID should be concise but clearly refer to the specific entity instance (e.g., 'SEXUAL_OFFENCES_ACT_SECTION_09' instead of just 'SECTION_09').
    entity_type: One of the following types, chosen based on the most precise fit:
        *   **PERSON:** A human individual.
        *   **ORGANIZATION:** A formal group, institution, company, or body.
        *   **LOCATION:** A specific geographical place.
        *   **LEGISLATION:** A proposed or enacted law, or a specific part of it (e.g., a Bill, Act, Section, Clause).
        *   **PARLIAMENTARY_ROLE:** A specific, formal designated position or office within a parliamentary or executive structure (e.g., Speaker, Prime Minister, Minister).
        *   **PARLIAMENTARY_PROCEDURE:** A formal rule, process, or action governing parliamentary conduct (e.g., a Motion, Question Time, a specific Reading of a Bill).
        *   **DATE_TIME:** A specific point or period in time (e.g., a full date, year, specific time, or duration).
        *   **NUMERIC_VALUE:** A quantitative expression, including amounts, percentages, counts, or other numerical data, particularly when it represents a significant, named financial or statistical figure (e.g., "GDP growth rate", "national debt figure").
        *   **POLICY_DOMAIN:** A broad, abstract area of public policy or national interest (e.g., Healthcare, Education, Climate Change).
        *   **OFFICIAL_DOCUMENT:** A formal government or parliamentary publication or record (e.g., a Report, Budget, Minutes, White Paper).
        *   **EVENT:** A specific, identifiable occurrence or happening (e.g., a meeting, election, disaster, ceremony).
        *   **ECONOMIC_CONCEPT:** A specific, named economic theory, principle, or a broad economic challenge (e.g., "Fiscal Policy", "Inflationary Pressure").
        *   **CONSTITUTIONAL_CONCEPT:** A fundamental legal principle, a specific article of a nation's constitution, or a concept related to governmental structure or rights (e.g., Republicanism, Human Rights, Separation of Powers).
        *   **INFRASTRUCTURE_PROJECT:** A specific public works development or major construction initiative (e.g., Airport Expansion, Road Project).
        *   **INTERNATIONAL_AGREEMENT:** A formal agreement, treaty, convention, or accord between sovereign states or international bodies.
        *   **REGIONAL_INITIATIVE:** A specific program, policy, or cooperative effort involving multiple nations in a region.
        *   **LEGAL_CASE_CONCEPT:** A specific court case, legal precedent, or a general legal principle discussed in a legal context.
        *   **EDUCATION_PROGRAM_ENTITY:** A named national education program, curriculum, or significant educational initiative.
        *   **HEALTH_PROGRAM_ENTITY:** A named national health program, public health initiative, or specific medical service program.
        *   **CULTURAL_HERITAGE_ENTITY:** A named entity or concept related to national identity, history, cultural preservation, or national symbols.
        *   **OTHER:** Any entity that does not fit into the above categories but is still relevant to the context of the text.

    entity_description: A general definition of the entity type itself, applicable across various contexts, not specific details from the provided text.
    Format each identified entity as a JSON object with keys: "entity_name", "entity_id", "entity_type", and "entity_description".

2.  From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly related to each other.
    For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
    provenance_segment_id: The provenance_segment_id from the start of the line where the relationship is stated.
    source_entity_id: The `entity_id` of the source entity, as identified in step 1.
    target_entity_id: The `entity_id` of the target entity, as identified in step 1.
    relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other.
    relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity (on a scale of 1-10).
    Format each relationship as a JSON object with keys: "provenance_segment_id", "source_entity_id", "target_entity_id", "relationship_description", and "relationship_strength".

    Every entity MUST have a relationship to at least one other entity.

Return output in English as a single JSON object with two keys: "entities" (an array of entity objects) and "statements" (an array of relationship objects).

**IMPORTANT INPUT FORMAT NOTE:**
The transcript will be divided into two sections:

1. **CONTEXT SEGMENTS**: These are provided for reference only to give you context about what was discussed earlier. Do NOT extract entities or statements from these segments.

2. **PROCESS THESE SEGMENTS**: These are the segments you should actually process to extract entities and statements from.

Each line will begin with a provenance_segment_id, followed by the text.
Example: `UU2CifSWj5Q_240_0 Also commanded to lay the 2023-2030 National Policy...`

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```json

  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "string",
      "entity_id": "string", 
      "entity_type": "string",

I need you to determine if these two entities represent the same real-world entity.

**EXISTING ENTITY:**
- Name: {existing_subgraph['entity']['entity_name']}
- Type: {existing_subgraph['entity']['entity_type']}
- Description: {existing_subgraph['entity']['entity_description']}
- Current Relationships: {len(existing_subgraph['relationships'])}

**NEW ENTITY:**
- Name: {new_entity['entity_name']}
- Type: {new_entity['entity_type']}  
- Description: {new_entity['entity_description']}
- New Relationships: {len([r for r in new_relationships if r['source_entity_id'] == new_entity['entity_id'] or r['target_entity_id'] == new_entity['entity_id']])}

**EXISTING ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS:**
{json.dumps([{
    'source': r['source_entity_id'],
    'target': r['target_entity_id'], 
    'description': r['relationship_description']
} for r in existing_subgraph['relationships'][:10]], indent=2)}

**NEW ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS:**

**QUESTION**: Do these entities represent the same real-world entity? Consider:
1. Are the names referring to the same thing?
2. Are the descriptions compatible?
3. Do the relationship patterns suggest they're the same entity?
